			<p>The Rod Streater Foundation was founded in 2014 as a donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

They strive to be a positive force in the lives of children who are impacted negatively by difficulties beyond their control.</p>
			<p>The foundation has a signature program, “Where’s Streater? Catch Him Here, There and Everywhere” which focuses their efforts on sponsoring free activities that promote healthy lifestyles, technology, culture and the arts.</p>
			<p>In the Bay Area, the foundation shares hands-on learning experiences with the kids at really special places like Oakland’s Chabot Space and Science Center, the San Francisco Zoo, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Disney Interactive, and making healthy apple pies with children with diabetes.
			In honor of his mother, “Team Streater” is where Rod Streater considers it his opportunity to reach out to children and adults who are overcoming cancer and to offer an inspirational message of “Hope and Courage”.</p>
